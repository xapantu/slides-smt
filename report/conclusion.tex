In \cite{AlbertiGP16, schweikardt}, there is already a way to solve
formulas with counting constraints. However, while they definitively explain that the problem
is decidable and why, they heavily rely on quantifier elimination and
thus may not be very practical nor easily integrated in modern SMT
solvers. I tried to compare the method of \cite{AlbertiGP16} and my solver,
unfortunately their implementation is not complete and most of our examples
cannot be checked by their tool.

The tool we developed could be improved. Divisibility constraints would be
useful to have a tool that supports all the Presburger arithmetic, even if we
did not find it useful for model checking related problems. Integration inside
an SMT solver could also provide a significant performance overhaul.
